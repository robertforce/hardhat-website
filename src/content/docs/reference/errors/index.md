## Hardhat Verify errors

### General errors

#### [HHE80000: Network not supported](#hhe80000)
The network is not supported by hardhat-verify. To see the list of supported networks, run:

```sh
npx hardhat verify --list-networks
```

To add support for a new network, see https://hardhat.org/verify-custom-networks

#### [HHE80001: Explorer request failed](#hhe80001)
The request to the explorer failed.

- Verify that the URL is correct.
- Ensure the service is up and reachable.
- Check your network connection and try again.

#### [HHE80002: Explorer request status code error](#hhe80002)
The request to the explorer returned a non-success status code.

- Verify that the URL is correct.
- Ensure the service is up and reachable.
- Check your network connection and try again.

#### [HHE80003: Unsupported solidity compiler version](#hhe80003)
The specified Solidity compiler version is not supported by the Etherscan API. Only versions 0.4.11 and above are supported.
For a full list of supported versions, visit: https://etherscan.io/solcversions

#### [HHE80004: Deployed bytecode not found](#hhe80004)
No bytecode was found at the specified address. This usually means the contract is not deployed or was deployed to a different network.
Please verify the address and selected network, and try again.

#### [HHE80005: Compiler version mismatch](#hhe80005)
The Solidity compiler version used to compile the deployed contract does not match any of the versions configured in your Hardhat project.

This mismatch may indicate:

- You're not on the same commit that was used to deploy the contract.
- The compiler version in your Hardhat config is incorrect.
- The address provided is not the deployed contract.
- The selected network is incorrect.

#### [HHE80006: Contract not found](#hhe80006)
The specified contract is not present in your project's artifacts. Please ensure the contract is compiled and the name is correct.

#### [HHE80007: Build info not found](#hhe80007)
The specified contract is present in your project, but its build info is missing. Please ensure the contract is compiled by Hardhat and that it is written in Solidity.

#### [HHE80008: Build info compiler version mismatch](#hhe80008)
The compiler version in the build info does not match the version encoded in the deployed bytecode.
Possible causes:

- Compiler settings were changed after deployment.
- The contract address is incorrect.
- The selected network is incorrect.

#### [HHE80009: Deployed bytecode mismatch](#hhe80009)
The bytecode at the specified address did not match the expected contract.

Possible causes:

- Your artifacts are outdated or missing; try running `npx hardhat compile --force --buildProfile production`.
- The contract code was modified after deployment.
- Compiler settings (optimizer, EVM version, etc.) changed after deployment.
- The provided address is incorrect.
- The selected network is incorrect.

#### [HHE80010: Multiple contract matches](#hhe80010)
The deployed bytecode matches multiple compiled contracts. Specify the exact contract using the `--contract` flag. For example:

```sh
npx hardhat verify --contract contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract <other args>
```


#### [HHE80011: Invalid library address](#hhe80011)
The address provided for a linked library is invalid. Please make sure the address is a valid Ethereum address.

#### [HHE80012: Library not found in contract](#hhe80012)
A library was specified using the "--libraries" option, but the selected contract does not use it.

If the contract uses external libraries, verify that the provided name matches the fully qualified name (FQN) of one of them, such as:

```
  contracts/Math.sol:SafeMath
```


#### [HHE80013: Library name is ambiguous](#hhe80013)
The specified library name matches multiple libraries used by the contract.

To resolve the ambiguity, provide the fully qualified library name in the format:

```
  path/to/LibraryFile.sol:LibraryName
```


#### [HHE80014: Duplicated library entry](#hhe80014)
The same library was specified more than once using both its short name and fully qualified name (FQN) in the `--libraries` option.

Only one form should be used for each library. Remove one of the entries and try again.

#### [HHE80015: Library address mismatch](#hhe80015)
Some libraries have conflicting addresses between what you provided and what was detected in the deployed bytecode.

Please ensure each library address is correct. You can remove entries from your input to use autodetection instead.

#### [HHE80016: Missing library addresses](#hhe80016)
One or more libraries required by the contract could not be detected from the deployed bytecode.

This usually happens when a library is only referenced in the contract's constructor. To resolve this, provide the missing library addresses using the "--libraries" option.

#### [HHE80017: Invalid constructor argument type](#hhe80017)
One of the arguments passed to the contract's constructor has an invalid JavaScript type.

This error occurs when you supply a value whose runtime type doesn't match the expected Solidity type. For example, you must pass a JS string for a Solidity string parameter.

Please verify that each constructor argument is the correct JS type.

#### [HHE80018: Invalid constructor argument count](#hhe80018)
The number of arguments provided to the contract's constructor doesn't match the number of parameters defined in its ABI.

This error occurs when you supply a different number of arguments than the constructor expects. For example, if the constructor expects two parameters but you provided three.

Please verify that you pass the exact number of arguments required by the constructor.

#### [HHE80019: Constructor argument value out of bounds](#hhe80019)
One of the arguments passed to the contract's constructor is outside the allowed range for its Solidity type (for example, passing 256 to a uint8 parameter).

This error occurs when a value exceeds the maximum or minimum allowed for the specified Solidity type.

Please ensure all argument values fit within the valid range for their respective Solidity types.

#### [HHE80020: Constructor arguments encoding failed](#hhe80020)
The constructor arguments provided for the contract could not be encoded correctly.
Please review the provided arguments and ensure they match the expected arguments defined in the contract's ABI.

#### [HHE80021: Missing bytecode at address](#hhe80021)
The explorer responded that the specified address does not contain bytecode. This usually means the contract was deployed recently and the explorer's backend has not yet indexed it.

Please wait a short time (e.g., 30-60 seconds) and try again. If you're running this from a script, wait for at least five confirmations before verifying.

#### [HHE80022: Contract already verified](#hhe80022)
The block explorer responded that the contract is already verified.

This typically occurs if you used the "--force" flag and the explorer does not support re-verification, or if the contract was previously verified with a full match.

#### [HHE80023: Contract verification request failed](#hhe80023)
The block explorer returned an error when attempting to verify the contract's source code.

Please check the returned message for details.

#### [HHE80024: Contract verification status polling failed](#hhe80024)
The block explorer returned a failure status when checking the verification status. Verification may still succeed; please check manually.

#### [HHE80025: Unexpected API response during contract verification](#hhe80025)
The block explorer API returned a message that doesn't match the expected format. This may indicate a change in the API or an issue with the request.

Please report this issue to the Hardhat team.

#### [HHE80026: Contract verification failed](#hhe80026)
Unable to verify the contract on the block explorer.

If your contract uses libraries whose addresses cannot be detected automatically, make sure you are providing the correct address for each undetectable library.

#### [HHE80027: Block explorer not configured](#hhe80027)

Block explorer information is missing in your chain descriptor configuration.

To enable contract verification, add an entry for the verification provider in the blockExplorers field of the relevant chain descriptor.
You can override the default chain descriptor by providing your own chainDescriptors object in the Hardhat config, with the following structure:

```
chainDescriptors: {
  <chainId>: {
    name: <name>,
    blockExplorers: {
      blockscout: { name: "Blockscout", url: <blockscout-url> apiUrl: <blockscout-api-url> };
      etherscan: { name: "Etherscan", url: <etherscan-url> apiUrl: <etherscan-api-url> };
    }
  }
}
```


#### [HHE80028: Address is not a contract](#hhe80028)
The block explorer responded that the address does not contain a contract. This usually means the address is incorrect, the contract was not deployed on the selected network, or there is a temporary issue with the block explorer not updating its index.
Please verify the address and network, and try again later if necessary.

#### [HHE80029: Block explorer API key is empty](#hhe80029)
The provided API key for the block explorer is empty. This can happen in the following cases:

- No "apiKey" field is configured in the hardhat config.
- The "apiKey" is explicitly set to an empty string in the Hardhat config.
- The "apiKey" is assigned to a config variable that resolves to an empty string at runtime.

To resolve this, set a valid non-empty API key in your Hardhat config, then try again.
