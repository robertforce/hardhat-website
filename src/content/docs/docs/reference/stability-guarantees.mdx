Hardhat doesn't follow semver strictly, but it still aims to be a stable and easy-to-use platform. We won't introduce breaking changes without notice, though we may introduce them in some minor versions.

These breaking changes fall into the following categories:

- Changing the default config (e.g. networks and solidity config)
- Dropping support for unmaintained Node.js versions (learn more about our [Node.js support policy](/docs/reference/nodejs-support))

## Simulated networks default config

Local simulated networks should closely resemble the chain they're simulating (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet) by default. Since Ethereum and Layer 2 chains introduce breaking changes through hardforks or network upgrades, we need to update their default config accordingly. For example, we'd eventually change the default value of the `hardfork` config for a certain Chain Type.

We'll only introduce these changes when a hardfork activates on the chain the Chain Type simulates, and we'll release them in a minor version. When we do this, we'll also modify other fields, like `blockGasLimit`, to match those of the simulated network.

## Avoid breaking changes introduced by Hardhat

Ethereum and Layer 2s are constantly evolving, so avoiding every breaking change can mean that your software may eventually stop working on the chain it was built for.

If you want to play it extra safe and ensure your project never changes, always use the same version of Node.js and install Hardhat using a [tilde range](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver#tilde-ranges-123-12-1) or by pinning it. We don't recommend this approach, but rather recommend committing your lockfile instead.
