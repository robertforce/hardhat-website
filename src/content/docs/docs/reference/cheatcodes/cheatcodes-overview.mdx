This section contains the documentation of all Solidity test cheatcodes supported by Hardhat. For more details on how to configure, implement and run Solidity tests in Hardhat, please refer to the [Solidity testing guide](/docs/guides/testing/using-solidity).

:::caution
This documentation assumes that you are using the Forge Standard Library and extending `Test` from `forge-std/Test.sol` in your Solidity test files.

You can find out more about `forge-std` in the [Forge Standard Library documentation](https://getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std).
