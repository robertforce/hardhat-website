Hardhat 3 launched with support for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `v22.10.0` or greater.

Hardhat 3 will support all subsequent even major versions of Node.js as long as they're maintained by the Node.js team.

Once an even major version is no longer maintained, we'll stop supporting it. This means:

- We won't test Hardhat using it
- We may start using features of Node.js that aren't available in that version
