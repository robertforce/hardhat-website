import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

By default, Hardhat 3 supports relative imports to local files. For example, if you have this project:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- my-project/
  - package.json
  - hardhat.config.ts
  - contracts/
    - Foo.sol
  - test/
    - Foo.t.sol
</FileTree>

The test `test/Foo.t.sol` would import `Foo.sol` using `"../contracts/Foo.sol"`. We recommend using this style of imports because it's compatible with every tool.

## Using remappings for absolute imports

If you want to use absolute imports and write `"contracts/Foo.sol"` instead, you can use a remapping.

To do this, add a `remappings.txt` file to the directory where you want to use absolute imports. For example, if you only want them for test files, add this:

```txt
// test/remappings.txt
contracts/=../contracts/
```

By adding the `remappings.txt` to the directory where it's needed, you avoid polluting other source files and keep your project compatible with more tools.
