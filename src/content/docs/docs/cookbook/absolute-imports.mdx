import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

By default, Hardhat 3 only supports relative imports to local files. For example, if you have this project:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- my-project/
  - package.json
  - hardhat.config.ts
  - contracts/
    - Foo.sol
  - test/
    - Foo.t.sol
</FileTree>

The test `test/Foo.t.sol` will have to import `Foo.sol` using `"../contracts/Foo.sol"`. We recommend you use this style of imports, as it's compatible with every tool.

## Using remappings for absolute imports

If you still want to use absolute imports, and be able to write `"contracts/Foo.sol"` instead, you can use a remapping.

To do it, add `remappings.txt` file to directory where you want to use absolute imports. For example, if you only want them for test files, you can add this:

```txt
// test/remappings.txt
contracts/=../contracts/
```

By adding the `remapping.txt` to the directory where it's needed, you avoid polluting other source files, and keep your project compatible with more tools.
