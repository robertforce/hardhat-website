By default, Hardhat generates compilation artifacts for all the contracts in your project, but not for those in the project's npm dependencies. If you want to generate artifacts for a specific file in an npm dependency, you can use the `npmFilesToBuild` property:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",
    npmFilesToBuild: ["some-dependency/contracts/SomeContract.sol"],
  },
});
```

You can use artifacts to deploy contracts, obtain their ABIs, and more. For example, once you've configured Hardhat to generate artifacts for `some-dependency/contracts/SomeContract.sol`, you can use that contract in your tests like this:

```ts
const someContract = await viem.deployContract("SomeContract");
```
