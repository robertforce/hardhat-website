Some projects need to compile different files with different Solidity versions. Hardhat lets you define multiple compiler configurations using an extended format of the `solidity` property:

```ts
solidity: {
  compilers: [
    {
      version: "0.7.6"
    },
    {
      version: "0.8.11"
    },
    {
      version: "0.8.29",
      settings: {
        optimizer: { enabled: true }
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

Hardhat compiles each Solidity file in your project using the **highest configured Solidity version** that's compatible with the version pragma of the file and its dependencies.

For example, given the configuration above:

- A file with `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` will be compiled with Solidity `0.8.29`, even though `0.8.11` is also compatible.
- A file with `pragma solidity ^0.7.0` will use Solidity `0.7.6`, which is the only valid matching version.
- A file with `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` that imports another file with `pragma solidity <0.8.20` will be compiled with `0.8.11`, because the combination of both restrictions makes it the highest compatible version.
