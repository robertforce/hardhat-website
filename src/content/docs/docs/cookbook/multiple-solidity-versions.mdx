Some projects need to compile different files with different solc versions. To enable this, Hardhat lets you define multiple compiler configurations using an extended format of the `solidity` property:

```ts
solidity: {
  compilers: [
    {
      version: "0.7.6"
    },
    {
      version: "0.8.11"
    },
    {
      version: "0.8.29",
      settings: {
        optimizer: { enabled: true }
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

Hardhat compiles each Solidity file in the project using the **highest configured solc version** that is compatible with the version pragma of the file and its dependencies.

For example, given the configuration above:

- A file with `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` will be compiled with solc `0.8.29`, even though `0.8.11` is also compatible with it.
- A file with `pragma solidity ^0.7.0` will use solc `0.7.6`, which is the only valid matching version.
