Hardhat supports the `http_proxy` environment variable. When this variable is set, Hardhat will send its requests through the given proxy for things like JSON-RPC requests, mainnet forking and downloading compilers.

There's also support for the `no_proxy` variable, which accepts a comma separated list of hosts or `"*"`. Any host included in this list will not be proxied. Note that requests to `"localhost"` or `"127.0.0.1"` are never proxied.
