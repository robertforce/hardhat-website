import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

When you deployed the `Counter` contract to the Sepolia network, Etherscan only showed you the raw bytecode of the contract. To see its source code, you need to verify it.

:::note
If you deploy a contract with a source that has already been verified on Etherscan, the contract will be automatically verified upon deployment. That's why we added a comment with a random nonce at the end of the `Counter.sol` file: to make sure the source code is unique for verification purposes.
:::

Before you can verify the contract, add an Etherscan API key to your configuration. If you don't have one, learn how to obtain it [here](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-an-api-key). Add the API key as a Configuration Variable in your keystore:

```ts ins={18-22}
// hardhat.config.ts
import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import { configVariable, defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.28",
  },
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: configVariable("SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"),
      accounts: [configVariable("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY")],
    },
  },
  verify: {
    etherscan: {
      apiKey: configVariable("ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"),
    },
  },
});
```

As you did before, add the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable to your keystore:

<Run command="hardhat keystore set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY" />

Now execute the Ignition module again, but this time with the `--verify` flag. Since you've already deployed the contracts, this won't re-deploy them, but it will submit the source code to Etherscan for verification:

<Run command="hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts --network sepolia --verify" />

If everything goes well, you should see output indicating that the verification was successful and a link to the verified contract on Etherscan.
