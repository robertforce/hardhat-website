import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";
import RunRemote from "@hh/RunRemote.astro";

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and a package manager (such as `npm` or `pnpm`) installed:

<Run preCommand="node --version" command="--version" />

## Creating your project

You'll create an empty directory and initialize a Hardhat project inside it:

<RunRemote
  preCommand={["mkdir hardhat-tutorial", "cd hardhat-tutorial"]}
  command="hardhat --init"
/>

You'll be prompted to select a few options. Use the defaults for everything **except the project type**:

1. Version: "Hardhat 3 Beta"
2. Directory: current directory (`"."`)
3. **Project type: "A minimal Hardhat project"** <Badge text="not default" variant="caution" />
4. Install dependencies: yes

Once the setup is complete, verify that everything is working with the following command:

<Run command="hardhat --help" />

You should see Hardhat's help output in your terminal.
