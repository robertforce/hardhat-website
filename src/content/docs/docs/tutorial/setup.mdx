Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and a package manager (such as `npm` or `pnpm`) installed:

<Run preCommand="node --version" command="--version" />

If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have an older version, you can learn how to install or update it using `nvm` or `volta` in [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Creating your project

You'll create an empty directory and initialize a Hardhat project inside it:

<RunRemote
  preCommand={["mkdir hardhat-tutorial", "cd hardhat-tutorial"]}
  command="hardhat --init"
/>

You'll be prompted to select a few options. Accept the defaults for everything **except the project type** (we'll use a minimal project):

1. Version: "Hardhat 3 Beta"
2. Directory: current directory (`"."`)
3. **Project type: "A minimal Hardhat project"** <Badge text="not default" variant="caution" />
4. Install dependencies: yes

Once the setup is complete, let's verify that everything is working:

<Run command="hardhat --help" />

If you see Hardhat's help output in your terminal, you're all set!

Now that your project is set up, you're ready to start building!
