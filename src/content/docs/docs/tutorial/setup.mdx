Before we start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and a package manager (such as `npm` or `pnpm`) installed:

<Run preCommand="node --version" command="--version" />

Let's start by creating an empty directory and initializing a Hardhat project inside it:

<RunRemote
  preCommand={["mkdir hardhat-tutorial", "cd hardhat-tutorial"]}
  command="hardhat --init"
/>

You'll be prompted to select a few options. Use the defaults for everything except the project type:

1. Version: "Hardhat 3 Beta" (default)
2. Directory: current (default)
3. **Project type: "A minimal Hardhat project" (not default)**
4. Install dependencies (default)

Once the setup is complete, verify that everything is working with the following command:

<Run command="hardhat --help" />

You should see Hardhat's help printed in your terminal.
