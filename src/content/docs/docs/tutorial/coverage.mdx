import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

The toolbox includes functionality to measure the coverage of your tests. This helps you identify parts of your code that aren't being tested.

Run the `test` task with the `--coverage` flag to get a coverage report:

<Run command="hardhat test --coverage" />

The output will show you a summary of the coverage. You can also open the `coverage/index.html` file in your browser to see a more detailed HTML report.
