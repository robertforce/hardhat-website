Hardhat 3 has built-in test coverage functionality to help you identify untested code. It works with Solidity tests by default, and with the `hardhat-toolbox-viem` plugin, it also works with [`node:test`](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) tests.

## Getting code coverage for Solidity tests

Generate a coverage report for your Solidity tests:

<Run command="hardhat test solidity --coverage" />

The output shows a coverage summary at the end. An HTML report is also automatically generated at `/coverage/html/index.html`.

## Getting code coverage for TypeScript tests

Generate a coverage report for your TypeScript tests:

<Run command="hardhat test nodejs --coverage" />

## Getting combined code coverage

Get combined coverage for both Solidity and TypeScript tests:

<Run command="hardhat test --coverage" />
