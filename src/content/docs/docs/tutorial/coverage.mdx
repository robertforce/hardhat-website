import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

The toolbox includes functionality to measure the coverage of your tests, helping you identify parts of your code that aren't being tested.

Run the following command to generate a coverage report for your Solidity tests:

<Run command="hardhat test solidity --coverage" />

The output will show you a summary of the coverage at the end.

Similarly, you can measure the coverage of your TypeScript tests by running:

<Run command="hardhat test nodejs --coverage" />

To get combined coverage for both Solidity and TypeScript tests, use the main `test` task:

<Run command="hardhat test --coverage" />
