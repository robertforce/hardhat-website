Welcome to the Hardhat 3 tutorial! In this hands-on guide, you'll build a simple project from scratch and learn Hardhat's core features along the way.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Compile smart contracts
- Write and run different types of tests
- Deploy your contracts to a live network
- Verify your contracts on Etherscan

**Prerequisites**: This tutorial assumes you're comfortable with smart contract concepts, Node.js, and the command line. If you're new to smart contracts, start with some introductory Solidity resources before diving in.

Let's get started!
