Welcome to Hardhat 3!

In this tutorial, you'll learn the main features of Hardhat by building a simple project from scratch. By the end, you'll know how to compile smart contracts, write different types of tests, and deploy your contracts to a live network.

This tutorial assumes you're familiar with smart contract development, Node.js, and the command line. If you're new to smart contracts, you should start with some introductory Solidity resources first.
