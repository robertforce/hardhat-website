Congratulations, you've completed the Hardhat 3 tutorial! You've learned how to set up a Hardhat project, write and run Solidity and Typescript tests, deploy contracts using Ignition, and verify the source code of your contracts.

Now you're ready to explore more advanced features of Hardhat:

- Read the guides for walkthroughs on specific features, like [writing Solidity tests](/docs/guides/writing-contracts/configuring-the-compiler) or [using Hardhat Ignition](/docs/guides/deployment/using-ignition).
- Check the explanations to better understand topics like [Configuration Variables](/docs/explanations/configuration-variables) or how [simulated networks](/docs/explanations/edr-simulated-networks) work.
- Go over the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) to learn about all the options you can use to customize Hardhat.
