import Install from "@hh/Install.astro";
import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

So far, you've been using Hardhat's built-in features. Now you'll extend Hardhat's functionality with plugins.

Plugins let you add new tasks, features, and integrations to Hardhat. You'll install the `hardhat-toolbox-viem` plugin, which you'll need for the rest of the tutorial.

Run this command to install the plugin:

<Install packages="@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition viem" />

This installs three packages. The `hardhat-toolbox-viem` plugin bundles several tools together, but you'll import `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition` and `viem` directly in your code later, so they need to be installed separately.

Import `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem` in your `hardhat.config.ts` file and add it to the `plugins` array. This loads the plugin and its dependencies into Hardhat, including `hardhat-ignition`:

```ts ins={2,6}
// hardhat.config.ts
import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.28",
  },
});
```

Run the help command to verify the plugin is loaded:

<Run command="hardhat -h" />

You'll see new tasks added by the plugin in the task list, like `test nodejs`.
