A Hardhat Project is an npm package that uses Hardhat. In other words, it's a directory with a `package.json` file, and a Hardhat config file either in the same directory or one of its subdirectories.

## Hardhat project root

The Hardhat project root directory is the directory containing the `package.json` file, matching the behavior of npm.

For example, in this case:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- **directory**
  - package.json
  - config/
    - hardhat.config.ts
</FileTree>

`directory` is the project root, not `config`.

### Recommended structure

We recommend keeping both the `package.json` and the `hardhat.config.ts` in the root of the project, and installing `hardhat` there.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- root
  - package.json Has `hardhat` installed
  - hardhat.config.ts
</FileTree>

## Nested projects and Hardhat installation

The `package.json` of the Hardhat project doesn't need to install Hardhat directly. The only requirement is that your config needs to be able to import it. This can be helpful for [integration tests of plugins](/docs/plugin-development/guides/integration-tests#testing-with-fixture-projects) and custom setups.

For example, in this case:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- **directory**
  - package.json Has `hardhat` installed
  - hardhat.config.ts
  - tests
    - **example-project**
      - package.json Doesn't have `hardhat` installed
      - hardhat.config.ts
</FileTree>

Both `directory` and `example-project` will be Hardhat projects, despite `hardhat` only being installed in `directory`.

## Usage with monorepos

If you're using a monorepo, each package can have multiple projects, as explained above. However, we recommend using the [Recommended structure](#recommended-structure) in each of your packages.
