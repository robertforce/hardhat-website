Hardhat 3 is production-ready and you can migrate today! We'll keep it in beta status as we work on missing features and stabilize it in the near future.

:::

Hardhat is a flexible and extensible development environment for Ethereum software. It helps you write, test, debug and deploy your smart contracts with ease, whether you're building a simple prototype or a complex production system.

This guide will walk you through the installation of our recommended setup, but as most of Hardhat's functionality comes from plugins, you are free to customize it or choose a completely different path.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22 or later installed on your system
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). We strongly recommend using pnpm.
- Text editor - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with our [Official Hardhat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

## Installation

First, create a new directory for your project:

```sh
mkdir hardhat-example
cd hardhat-example
```

Once that's done, initialize your Hardhat project by running:

<RunRemote command="hardhat --init" />

This command will prompt you with a few configuration options. You can accept the default answers to quickly create a working setup.

Using the defaults will initialize the project in the current directory, and automatically install all of its required dependencies. You can learn more about that's included in your sample project by reading the [`hardhat-toolbox-viem`](/docs/plugins/hardhat-toolbox-viem) documentation, which is the recommended setup you are using.

After the setup is complete, you'll have a fully working Hardhat 3 project with everything you need to get started. Run the Hardhat help to verify the project was set up correctly:

<Run command="hardhat --help" />

To try out a complete test run of your project, run:

<Run command="hardhat test" />

## Project structure

The Hardhat project initialization from the previous section creates the following file structure:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- hardhat.config.ts
- contracts
  - Counter.sol
  - Counter.t.sol
- test
  - Counter.ts
- ignition
  - modules
    - Counter.ts
- scripts
  - send-op-tx.ts
</FileTree>

Here's a quick overview of these files and directories:

- `hardhat.config.ts`: The main configuration file for your project. It defines settings like the Solidity compiler version, network configurations, and the plugins and tasks your project uses.

- `contracts`: Contains your project's Solidity contracts. You can also include Solidity test files here by using the `.t.sol` extension.

- `test`: Used for TypeScript integration tests. You can also include Solidity test files here.

- `ignition`: Holds your [Hardhat Ignition](/ignition) deployment modules, which describe how your contracts should be deployed. Learn more about them [here](/docs/guides/deployment/using-ignition).

- `scripts`: A place for any custom scripts that automate parts of your workflow. Scripts have full access to Hardhat's runtime and can use plugins, connect to networks, deploy contracts, and more.
