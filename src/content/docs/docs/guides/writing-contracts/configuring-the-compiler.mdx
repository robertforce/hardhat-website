Solidity compilation in Hardhat is fully customizable. This guide explains the main ways in which compilation can be configured.

## Configuring the compiler version and settings

The simplest way to configure compilation is to specify the Solidity compiler version and, optionally, its settings:

```ts {"Optional settings:": 8-11}
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",

    settings: {
      /* solc settings, as expected by solc */
    },
  },
});
```

### Enabling the optimizer

One common use of settings is enabling optimizations. You can also define the number of runs, which affects how the optimizer balances between code size and execution cost:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Enabling `viaIR`

Another use case is enabling the [IR-based code generator](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/ir-breaking-changes.html). This compilation mode can be slower, but it enables more powerful optimizations:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",
    settings: {
      viaIR: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Other settings

The `settings` property accepts the same options supported by the chosen compiler version. For the full details, check [solc's documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/).
