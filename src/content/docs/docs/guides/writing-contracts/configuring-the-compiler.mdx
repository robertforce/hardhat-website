Solidity compilation in Hardhat is fully customizable. This guide covers the main ways you can configure the compiler to suit your project's needs.

## Configuring the compiler version and settings

The simplest way to configure compilation is to set the Solidity compiler version and, optionally, its settings:

```ts {"Optional settings:": 8-11}
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",

    settings: {
      /* solc settings, as expected by solc */
    },
  },
});
```

### Enabling the optimizer

One common use of settings is enabling optimizations. When you enable the optimizer, you can also define the number of runs, which affects how it balances between code size and execution cost:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Enabling `viaIR`

You can also enable the [IR-based code generator](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/ir-breaking-changes.html). While this compilation mode can be slower, it enables more powerful optimizations:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.29",
    settings: {
      viaIR: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Other settings

The `settings` property accepts the same options supported by the chosen compiler version. For the full details, check [solc's documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/).
