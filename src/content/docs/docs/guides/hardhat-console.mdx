import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

The built-in `console` task starts a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) that can be used to experiment with your contracts and the [Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE)](/docs/explanations/hardhat-runtime-environment).

## Starting the console

To start a Hardhat console, run the following command:

<Run command="hardhat console" />

The `console` task starts a [Node.js REPL](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-use-the-nodejs-repl) similar to the one you get when you run `node` in your terminal, but with some added features:

- The HRE and some of its properties are globally available
- Your project is built before the REPL starts
- It maintains a separate command history for each project

Here's an example where you deploy a contract and interact with it:

```
> const { viem } = await network.connect()
> const counter = await viem.deployContract("Counter")
> await counter.write.inc()
> await counter.read.x()
1n
```

To skip compilation before starting the console, pass the `--no-compile` flag:

<Run command="hardhat console --no-compile" />

## Running commands on startup

The `console` task accepts an optional list of positional arguments. Each argument you provide will be executed as a command immediately after the REPL starts, letting you run a series of commands automatically:

<Run command='hardhat console "const { viem } = await network.connect();" />' />

Make sure to wrap each command in quotes to avoid issues with your shell interpreting special characters.

You can also define a custom task that runs `console` with some predefined commands. For example:

```ts {5-10}
// hardhat.config.ts
import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
import { defineConfig, task } from "hardhat/config";

const myConsole = task(
  "my-console",
  "Starts a console with predefined commands",
)
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/my-console.js"))
  .build();

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: "0.8.28",
  tasks: [myConsole],
});
```

```ts
// tasks/my-console.ts
export default function myConsoleTask(_, hre) {
  return hre.tasks.getTask("console").run({
    commands: ["const { viem } = await network.connect();"],
  });
}
```
