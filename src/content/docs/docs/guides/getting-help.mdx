---

Hardhat has a strong community ready to help. This guide shows you where to ask for help and how to get answers quickly.

Start with the [GitHub Discussions section in the Hardhat repository](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/discussions). Search there first, as the answer may already exist.

If you can't find what you're looking for, [create a new Discussion](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/discussions/new).

If you prefer real-time chat, join our [Discord Server](https://hardhat.org/discord). Read its rules and ask for help in the right channel.

## Asking an effective question

To get a quick answer on GitHub Discussions or Discord, make sure your question includes:

1. A clear description of what you're trying to do.
2. The results you're getting and how they differ from what you expect. Consider running with [debug logs enabled](/docs/cookbook/debug-logs) to share the complete view of what's happening.
3. Which version of Hardhat you're running and which plugins and their versions you're using.
4. Specific and concise instructions on how to reproduce your problem. Ideally, provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) or a link to a public repository.

## Reporting a bug

If you think you've found a bug in Hardhat, please [report it](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml).

Before reporting a bug, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Hardhat and its plugins. Your problem may already be fixed.
2. Try to determine whether the issue is coming from a plugin by running your project with some of them disabled. We only accept bug reports for plugins published by us, all of which start with `@nomicfoundation/`. If you find an issue with a plugin published by someone else, raise it with that publisher.
3. Search GitHub for other reports of the same problem. If you find one, comment on the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

When reporting a bug or commenting on an existing issue, include all the information described in [Asking an effective question](#asking-an-effective-question). The more information you provide, the faster your problem will get fixed.
