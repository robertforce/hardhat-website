### Signature

```solidity
function getBlobBaseFee() external view returns (uint256 blobBaseFee);
```

### Description

Gets the current `block.blobbasefee`.
You should use this instead of `block.blobbasefee` if you use `vm.blobBaseFee`, as `block.blobbasefee` is assumed to be constant across a transaction,
and as a result will get optimized out by the compiler.
