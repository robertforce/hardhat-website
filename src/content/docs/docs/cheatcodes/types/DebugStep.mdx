### Definiton

```solidity

    /// The stack before executing the step of the run.
    /// stack\[0\] represents the top of the stack.
    /// and only stack data relevant to the opcode execution is contained.
    uint256[] stack;
    /// The memory input data before executing the step of the run.
    /// only input data relevant to the opcode execution is contained.
    ///
    /// e.g. for MLOAD, it will have memory\[offset:offset+32\] copied here.
    /// the offset value can be get by the stack data.
    bytes memoryInput;
    /// The opcode that was accessed.
    uint8 opcode;
    /// The call depth of the step.
    uint64 depth;
    /// Whether the call end up with out of gas error.
    bool isOutOfGas;
    /// The contract address where the opcode is running
    address contractAddr;
}
