### Definition

```solidity
struct PotentialRevert {
    /// The allowed origin of the revert opcode; address(0) allows reverts from any address
    address reverter;
    /// When true, only matches on the beginning of the revert data, otherwise, matches on entire revert data
    bool partialMatch;
    /// The data to use to match encountered reverts
    bytes revertData;
}
```

### Description

Represents a "potential" revert reason from a single subsequent call when using `vm.assumeNoReverts`.
Reverts that match will result in a FOUNDRY::ASSUME rejection, whereas unmatched reverts will be surfaced
as normal.
