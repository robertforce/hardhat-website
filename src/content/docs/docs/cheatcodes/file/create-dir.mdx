## `createDir`

### Signature

```solidity
function createDir(string calldata path, bool recursive) external;
```

### Description

Creates a new, empty directory at the provided path.
This cheatcode will revert in the following situations, but is not limited to just these cases:
- User lacks permissions to modify `path`.
- A parent of the given path doesn't exist and `recursive` is false.
- `path` already exists and `recursive` is false.
`path` is relative to the project root.
