### Signature

```solidity
function copyFile(string calldata from, string calldata to) external returns (uint64 copied);
```

### Description

Copies the contents of one file to another. This function will **overwrite** the contents of `to`.
On success, the total number of bytes copied is returned and it is equal to the length of the `to` file as reported by `metadata`.
Both `from` and `to` are relative to the project root.
