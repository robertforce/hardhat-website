When deploying contracts, you may want to deploy them to a deterministic address. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as deploying a contract to the same address on multiple networks. Hardhat Ignition makes this easy by allowing you to deploy your existing Ignition modules via a `create2` deployment utilizing the [CreateX factory](https://createx.rocks/).

:::tip

As is the case when using any unaudited contract system, please be aware of the [security considerations](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx?tab=readme-ov-file#security-considerations) of using the CreateX factory on a mainnet network.

## Deploying on the Sepolia testnet

We are going to use the [Sepolia testnet](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#sepolia) to deploy our Ignition module, so you need to add this network in your Hardhat config. Here we are using [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) to connect to the network.

:::tip

You can find more info about using Hardhat configuration variables in the [configuration variable guide](/docs/guides/configuration-variables).

:::

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { configVariable, defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

// Go to https://alchemy.com, sign up, create a new App in
// its dashboard, and set the Hardhat configuration variable
// ALCHEMY_RPC_URL to the full RPC URL, including the API key
const ALCHEMY_RPC_URL = configVariable("ALCHEMY_RPC_URL");

// Replace this private key with your Sepolia test account private key
// To export your private key from Coinbase Wallet, go to
// Settings > Developer Settings > Show private key
// To export your private key from Metamask, open Metamask and
// go to Account Details > Export Private Key
// Beware: NEVER put real Ether into testing accounts
const SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY = configVariable("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY");

export default defineConfig({
  // ...rest of your config...
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: ALCHEMY_RPC_URL,
      accounts: [SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
});
```

To deploy on Sepolia you need to send some Sepolia ether to the address that's going to be making the deployment. You can get testnet ether from a faucet, a service that distributes testing-ETH for free. Here is one for Sepolia:

- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- [QuickNode Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

:::tip

This guide assumes you are using the contracts and Ignition module from the [quick start guide](/ignition/docs/getting-started), but the steps are the same for any deployment.

:::

Our last step before deploying is to add a salt for the deployment. This step is required to avoid any potential collisions with other deployments. The salt must be a 32 byte hex encoded string. You can add the salt via your Hardhat config:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...rest of your config...
  ignition: {
    strategyConfig: {
      create2: {
        // To learn more about salts, see the CreateX documentation
        salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can now run the deployment with `create2` using the newly added Sepolia network:

<Run command="hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Apollo.ts --network sepolia --strategy create2" />

The `--strategy create2` flag tells Ignition to deploy the module using `create2`. You should see output similar to the following:

```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully (evm target: paris).
Hardhat Ignition 🚀

Deploying [ Apollo ] with strategy create2

[ Apollo ] successfully deployed 🚀

Deployed Addresses

Apollo#Rocket - 0x10D3deBd2F40F8EaB28a1d3b472a1269a12E9855
```

Deploying this module using the `create2` strategy will deploy the contract to this same address, regardless of what network you're deploying to.
